    <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[33]

        Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[34][35]
        
        Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[36] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[37]
        
        Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.</p>

    <p>PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) used for programming in Python. It provides code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester, integration with version control systems, and supports web development with Django. PyCharm is developed by the Czech company JetBrains.[5]

        It is cross-platform, working on Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux. PyCharm has a Professional Edition, released under a proprietary license and a Community Edition released under the Apache License.[6] PyCharm Community Edition is less extensive than the Professional Edition.</p>

    <p>Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code,[9] is a source-code editor made by Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS.[10] Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add functionality.

        In the Stack Overflow 2022 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular developer environment tool among 71,010 respondents, with 74.48% reporting that they use it.[11]</p>
